# File to PDF Converter

## Overview

This is a Flask-based web application that converts various file formats (Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, images, and text files) to PDF format. The application provides a simple drag-and-drop interface for file uploads and uses LibreOffice for document conversions.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

The application follows a traditional Flask web application architecture with a clean separation of concerns:

- **Frontend**: Bootstrap-based responsive UI with drag-and-drop functionality
- **Backend**: Flask web framework with file upload and conversion capabilities
- **File Processing**: LibreOffice headless mode for document conversions
- **Storage**: Local file system for temporary file storage

## Key Components

### 1. Flask Application (`app.py`)
- Main application configuration and initialization
- Sets up file upload limits (50MB max)
- Configures upload and converted file directories
- Implements ProxyFix middleware for deployment behind reverse proxies

### 2. Route Handlers (`routes.py`)
- `/` - Serves the main upload interface
- `/upload` - Handles file uploads with validation
- File type validation for supported formats (DOC, DOCX, XLS, XLSX, PPT, PPTX, images, TXT)
- UUID-based file naming to prevent conflicts

### 3. Conversion Engine (`converter.py`)
- Modular conversion system supporting multiple file formats
- LibreOffice headless mode for Office document conversions
- Separate conversion functions for different file types
- Error handling and logging for conversion failures

### 4. Frontend Interface
- **HTML Template** (`templates/index.html`): Bootstrap-based responsive design
- **CSS Styling** (`static/css/style.css`): Custom styling with gradient backgrounds and hover effects
- **JavaScript** (`static/js/main.js`): Drag-and-drop functionality and AJAX file uploads

## Data Flow

1. **File Upload**: User selects or drags a file to the upload area
2. **Validation**: Server validates file type and size constraints
3. **Storage**: File is saved with a unique UUID-based filename
4. **Conversion**: Appropriate converter is called based on file extension
5. **Response**: Converted PDF is made available for download
6. **Cleanup**: Temporary files are managed (implementation pending)

## External Dependencies

### System Dependencies
- **LibreOffice**: Required for converting Office documents (Word, Excel, PowerPoint)
- **Python Packages**: Flask, Werkzeug for web framework functionality

### Frontend Dependencies
- **Bootstrap 5.3.0**: UI framework for responsive design
- **Font Awesome 6.0.0**: Icon library for visual elements

## Deployment Strategy

The application is configured for flexible deployment:

- **Development**: Direct Flask development server (`app.run()`)
- **Production**: WSGI-compatible with ProxyFix middleware for reverse proxy deployment
- **Environment Configuration**: Uses environment variables for sensitive settings (SESSION_SECRET)
- **File System**: Requires persistent storage for upload and converted directories

### Key Deployment Considerations

1. **File Storage**: Currently uses local file system - may need cloud storage for scalability
2. **LibreOffice Dependency**: Must be installed on deployment environment
3. **Resource Management**: No automatic cleanup of temporary files implemented
4. **Security**: File type validation prevents most malicious uploads
5. **Scalability**: Single-threaded conversion process may become bottleneck

## Technical Notes

- **File Size Limit**: 50MB maximum per upload
- **Supported Formats**: DOC/DOCX, XLS/XLSX, PPT/PPTX, common image formats, TXT, CSV, PDF, RTF, ODT, ODS, ODP
- **Conversion Timeout**: 60-second timeout for LibreOffice operations
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging for debugging conversion issues
- **File Naming**: UUID-based system prevents filename conflicts
- **Batch Processing**: Support for multiple file uploads and conversions
- **Quality Options**: High, medium, and low quality conversion settings
- **Password Protection**: Basic framework (implementation pending)
- **File Preview**: Text and image preview capabilities
- **Conversion History**: Track and display recent conversions
